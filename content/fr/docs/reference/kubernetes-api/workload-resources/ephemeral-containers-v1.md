  *Stratégie de patch : merge sur la clé `name`*
  
  A list of ephemeral containers associated with this pod. New ephemeral containers may be appended to this list, but existing ephemeral containers may not be removed or modified.





## EphemeralContainer {#EphemeralContainer}

An EphemeralContainer is a container that may be added temporarily to an existing pod for user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a pod is removed or restarted. If an ephemeral container causes a pod to exceed its resource allocation, the pod may be evicted. Ephemeral containers may not be added by directly updating the pod spec. They must be added via the pod's ephemeralcontainers subresource, and they will appear in the pod spec once added. This is an alpha feature enabled by the EphemeralContainers feature flag.

<hr>

  Name of the ephemeral container specified as a DNS_LABEL. This name must be unique among all containers, init containers and ephemeral containers.

- **targetContainerName** (string)

  If set, the name of the container from PodSpec that this ephemeral container targets. The ephemeral container will be run in the namespaces (IPC, PID, etc) of this container. If not set then the ephemeral container is run in whatever namespaces are shared for the pod. Note that the container runtime must support this feature.

  Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF. Default is false.

- **stdinOnce** (boolean)

  Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false

- **tty** (boolean)

  Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true. Default is false.

### Not allowed

  - **ports.name** (string)

    If specified, this must be an IANA_SVC_NAME and unique within the pod. Each named port in a pod must have a unique name. Name for the port that can be referred to by services.

  - **ports.protocol** (string)

    Protocol for port. Must be UDP, TCP, or SCTP. Defaults to "TCP".

- **resources** (ResourceRequirements)

  Resources are not allowed for ephemeral containers. Ephemeral containers use spare resources already allocated to the pod.

  - **resources.requests** (map[string]<a href="{{< ref "../common-definitions/quantity#Quantity" >}}">Quantity</a>)

    Requests describes the minimum amount of compute resources required. If Requests is omitted for a container, it defaults to Limits if that is explicitly specified, otherwise to an implementation-defined value. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

- **lifecycle** (Lifecycle)

  Lifecycle is not allowed for ephemeral containers.

  <a name="Lifecycle"></a>
  *Lifecycle describes actions that the management system should take in response to container lifecycle events. For the PostStart and PreStop lifecycle handlers, management of the container blocks until the action is complete, unless the container process fails, in which case the handler is aborted.*

  - **lifecycle.postStart** (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#Handler" >}}">Handler</a>)

    PostStart is called immediately after a container is created. If the handler fails, the container is terminated and restarted according to its restart policy. Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks

  - **lifecycle.preStop** (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#Handler" >}}">Handler</a>)

    PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure, preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the container crashes or exits. The reason for termination is passed to the handler. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the PreStop hooked is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace period. Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes or until the termination grace period is reached. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks

- **livenessProbe** (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#Probe" >}}">Probe</a>)

    The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in PodSecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

  - **securityContext.runAsNonRoot** (boolean)

    Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such validation will be performed. May also be set in PodSecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

  - **securityContext.runAsGroup** (int64)

    The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime default if unset. May also be set in PodSecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.
