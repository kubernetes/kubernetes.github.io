## Users in Kubernetes

All Kubernetes clusters have two categories of users: service accounts managed
by Kubernetes, and normal users.

It is assumed that a cluster-independent service manages normal users in the following ways:

- an administrator distributing private keys
- a user store like Keystone or Google Accounts
- a file with a list of usernames and passwords

In this regard, _Kubernetes does not have objects which represent normal user
accounts._ Normal users cannot be added to a cluster through an API call.

Even though a normal user cannot be added via an API call, any user that
presents a valid certificate signed by the cluster's certificate authority
(CA) is considered authenticated. In this configuration, Kubernetes determines
the username from the common name field in the 'subject' of the cert (e.g.,
"/CN=bob"). From there, the role based access control (RBAC) sub-system would
determine whether the user is authorized to perform a specific operation on a
resource. For more details, refer to the normal users topic in
[certificate request](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#normal-user)
for more details about this.

In contrast, service accounts are users managed by the Kubernetes API. They are
bound to specific namespaces, and created automatically by the API server or
manually through API calls. Service accounts are tied to a set of credentials
stored as `Secrets`, which are mounted into pods allowing in-cluster processes
to talk to the Kubernetes API.

API requests are tied to either a normal user or a service account, or are treated
as [anonymous requests](#anonymous-requests). This means every process inside or outside the cluster, from
a human user typing `kubectl` on a workstation, to `kubelets` on nodes, to members
of the control plane, must authenticate when making requests to the API server,
or be treated as an anonymous user.

## Authentication strategies

Kubernetes uses client certificates, bearer tokens, an authenticating proxy, or HTTP basic auth to
authenticate API requests through authentication plugins. As HTTP requests are
made to the API server, plugins attempt to associate the following attributes
with the request:

* Username: a string which identifies the end user. Common values might be `kube-admin` or `jane@example.com`.
* UID: a string which identifies the end user and attempts to be more consistent and unique than username.
* Groups: a set of strings, each of which indicates the user's membership in a named logical collection of users. Common values might be `system:masters` or `devops-team`.
* Extra fields: a map of strings to list of strings which holds additional information authorizers may find useful.

All values are opaque to the authentication system and only hold significance
when interpreted by an [authorizer](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/).

You can enable multiple authentication methods at once. You should usually use at least two methods:

- service account tokens for service accounts
- at least one other method for user authentication.

When multiple authenticator modules are enabled, the first module
to successfully authenticate the request short-circuits evaluation.
The API server does not guarantee the order authenticators run in.

The `system:authenticated` group is included in the list of groups for all authenticated users.

Integrations with other authentication protocols (LDAP, SAML, Kerberos, alternate x509 schemes, etc)
can be accomplished using an [authenticating proxy](#authenticating-proxy) or the
[authentication webhook](#webhook-token-authentication).

### X509 Client Certs

Client certificate authentication is enabled by passing the `--client-ca-file=SOMEFILE`
option to API server. The referenced file must contain one or more certificate authorities
to use to validate client certificates presented to the API server. If a client certificate
is presented and verified, the common name of the subject is used as the user name for the
request. As of Kubernetes 1.4, client certificates can also indicate a user's group memberships
using the certificate's organization fields. To include multiple group memberships for a user,
include multiple organization fields in the certificate.

For example, using the `openssl` command line tool to generate a certificate signing request:

``` bash
openssl req -new -key jbeda.pem -out jbeda-csr.pem -subj "/CN=jbeda/O=app1/O=app2"
```

This would create a CSR for the username "jbeda", belonging to two groups, "app1" and "app2".

See [Managing Certificates](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/certificates/) for how to generate a client cert.

### Static Token File

The API server reads bearer tokens from a file when given the `--token-auth-file=SOMEFILE` option on the command line.  Currently, tokens last indefinitely, and the token list cannot be
changed without restarting API server.

The token file is a csv file with a minimum of 3 columns: token, user name, user uid,
followed by optional group names.

{{< note >}}
If you have more than one group the column must be double quoted e.g.

```conf
token,user,uid,"group1,group2,group3"
```
{{< /note >}}

#### Putting a Bearer Token in a Request

When using bearer token authentication from an http client, the API
server expects an `Authorization` header with a value of `Bearer
THETOKEN`.  The bearer token must be a character sequence that can be
put in an HTTP header value using no more than the encoding and
quoting facilities of HTTP.  For example: if the bearer token is
`31ada4fd-adec-460c-809a-9e56ceb75269` then it would appear in an HTTP
header as shown below.

```http
Authorization: Bearer 31ada4fd-adec-460c-809a-9e56ceb75269
```

### Bootstrap Tokens

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.18" state="stable" >}}

To allow for streamlined bootstrapping for new clusters, Kubernetes includes a
dynamically-managed Bearer token type called a *Bootstrap Token*. These tokens
are stored as Secrets in the `kube-system` namespace, where they can be
dynamically managed and created. Controller Manager contains a TokenCleaner
controller that deletes bootstrap tokens as they expire.

The tokens are of the form `[a-z0-9]{6}.[a-z0-9]{16}`.  The first component is a
Token ID and the second component is the Token Secret.  You specify the token
in an HTTP header as follows:

```http
Authorization: Bearer 781292.db7bc3a58fc5f07e
```

You must enable the Bootstrap Token Authenticator with the
`--enable-bootstrap-token-auth` flag on the API Server.  You must enable
the TokenCleaner controller via the `--controllers` flag on the Controller
Manager.  This is done with something like `--controllers=*,tokencleaner`.
`kubeadm` will do this for you if you are using it to bootstrap a cluster.

The authenticator authenticates as `system:bootstrap:<Token ID>`.  It is
included in the `system:bootstrappers` group.  The naming and groups are
intentionally limited to discourage users from using these tokens past
bootstrapping.  The user names and group can be used (and are used by `kubeadm`)
to craft the appropriate authorization policies to support bootstrapping a
cluster.

Please see [Bootstrap Tokens](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/bootstrap-tokens/) for in depth
documentation on the Bootstrap Token authenticator and controllers along with
how to manage these tokens with `kubeadm`.

### Service Account Tokens

A service account is an automatically enabled authenticator that uses signed
bearer tokens to verify requests. The plugin takes two optional flags:

* `--service-account-key-file` A file containing a PEM encoded key for signing bearer tokens.
If unspecified, the API server's TLS private key will be used.
* `--service-account-lookup` If enabled, tokens which are deleted from the API will be revoked.

Service accounts are usually created automatically by the API server and
associated with pods running in the cluster through the `ServiceAccount`
[Admission Controller](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/). Bearer tokens are
mounted into pods at well-known locations, and allow in-cluster processes to
talk to the API server. Accounts may be explicitly associated with pods using the
`serviceAccountName` field of a `PodSpec`.

{{< note >}}
`serviceAccountName` is usually omitted because this is done automatically.
{{< /note >}}

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1 # this apiVersion is relevant as of Kubernetes 1.9
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
    # ...
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: bob-the-bot
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
```

Service account bearer tokens are perfectly valid to use outside the cluster and
can be used to create identities for long standing jobs that wish to talk to the
Kubernetes API. To manually create a service account, use the `kubectl create
serviceaccount (NAME)` command. This creates a service account in the current
namespace and an associated secret.

```bash
kubectl create serviceaccount jenkins
```

```none
serviceaccount "jenkins" created
```

Check an associated secret:

```bash
kubectl get serviceaccounts jenkins -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  # ...
secrets:
- name: jenkins-token-1yvwg
```

The created secret holds the public CA of the API server and a signed JSON Web
Token (JWT).

```bash
kubectl get secret jenkins-token-1yvwg -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  ca.crt: (APISERVER'S CA BASE64 ENCODED)
  namespace: ZGVmYXVsdA==
  token: (BEARER TOKEN BASE64 ENCODED)
kind: Secret
metadata:
  # ...
type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
```

{{< note >}}
Values are base64 encoded because secrets are always base64 encoded.
{{< /note >}}

The signed JWT can be used as a bearer token to authenticate as the given service
account. See [above](#putting-a-bearer-token-in-a-request) for how the token is included
in a request.  Normally these secrets are mounted into pods for in-cluster access to
the API server, but can be used from outside the cluster as well.

Service accounts authenticate with the username `system:serviceaccount:(NAMESPACE):(SERVICEACCOUNT)`,
and are assigned to the groups `system:serviceaccounts` and `system:serviceaccounts:(NAMESPACE)`.

WARNING: Because service account tokens are stored in secrets, any user with
read access to those secrets can authenticate as the service account. Be cautious
when granting permissions to service accounts and read capabilities for secrets.

### OpenID Connect Tokens

[OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) is a flavor of OAuth2 supported by
some OAuth2 providers, notably Azure Active Directory, Salesforce, and Google.
The protocol's main extension of OAuth2 is an additional field returned with
the access token called an [ID Token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken).
This token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) with well known fields, such as a user's
email, signed by the server.

To identify the user, the authenticator uses the `id_token` (not the `access_token`)
from the OAuth2 [token response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#TokenResponse)
as a bearer token.  See [above](#putting-a-bearer-token-in-a-request) for how the token
is included in a request.

1.  Login to your identity provider
2.  Your identity provider will provide you with an `access_token`, `id_token` and a `refresh_token`
3.  When using `kubectl`, use your `id_token` with the `--token` flag or add it directly to your `kubeconfig`
4.  `kubectl` sends your `id_token` in a header called Authorization to the API server
5.  The API server will make sure the JWT signature is valid by checking against the certificate named in the configuration
6.  Check to make sure the `id_token` hasn't expired
7.  Make sure the user is authorized
8.  Once authorized the API server returns a response to `kubectl`
9.  `kubectl` provides feedback to the user


Since all of the data needed to validate who you are is in the `id_token`, Kubernetes doesn't need to
"phone home" to the identity provider.  In a model where every request is stateless this provides a very scalable solution for authentication.  It does offer a few challenges:

1. Kubernetes has no "web interface" to trigger the authentication process.  There is no browser or interface to collect credentials which is why you need to authenticate to your identity provider first.
2. The `id_token` can't be revoked, it's like a certificate so it should be short-lived (only a few minutes) so it can be very annoying to have to get a new token every few minutes.
3. To authenticate to the Kubernetes dashboard, you must use the `kubectl proxy` command or a reverse proxy that injects the `id_token`.

#### Configuring the API Server

To enable the plugin, configure the following flags on the API server:

| Parameter | Description | Example | Required |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- | ------- |
| `--oidc-issuer-url` | URL of the provider which allows the API server to discover public signing keys. Only URLs which use the `https://` scheme are accepted.  This is typically the provider's discovery URL without a path, for example "https://accounts.google.com" or "https://login.salesforce.com".  This URL should point to the level below .well-known/openid-configuration | If the discovery URL is `https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`, the value should be `https://accounts.google.com` | Yes |
| `--oidc-client-id` |  A client id that all tokens must be issued for. | kubernetes | Yes |
| `--oidc-username-claim` | JWT claim to use as the user name. By default `sub`, which is expected to be a unique identifier of the end user. Admins can choose other claims, such as `email` or `name`, depending on their provider. However, claims other than `email` will be prefixed with the issuer URL to prevent naming clashes with other plugins. | sub | No |
| `--oidc-username-prefix` | Prefix prepended to username claims to prevent clashes with existing names (such as `system:` users). For example, the value `oidc:` will create usernames like `oidc:jane.doe`. If this flag isn't provided and `--oidc-username-claim` is a value other than `email` the prefix defaults to `( Issuer URL )#` where `( Issuer URL )` is the value of `--oidc-issuer-url`. The value `-` can be used to disable all prefixing. | `oidc:` | No |
| `--oidc-groups-claim` | JWT claim to use as the user's group. If the claim is present it must be an array of strings. | groups | No |
| `--oidc-groups-prefix` | Prefix prepended to group claims to prevent clashes with existing names (such as `system:` groups). For example, the value `oidc:` will create group names like `oidc:engineering` and `oidc:infra`. | `oidc:` | No |
| `--oidc-required-claim` | A key=value pair that describes a required claim in the ID Token. If set, the claim is verified to be present in the ID Token with a matching value. Repeat this flag to specify multiple claims. | `claim=value` | No |
| `--oidc-ca-file` | The path to the certificate for the CA that signed your identity provider's web certificate.  Defaults to the host's root CAs. | `/etc/kubernetes/ssl/kc-ca.pem` | No |

Importantly, the API server is not an OAuth2 client, rather it can only be
configured to trust a single issuer. This allows the use of public providers,
such as Google, without trusting credentials issued to third parties. Admins who
wish to utilize multiple OAuth clients should explore providers which support the
`azp` (authorized party) claim, a mechanism for allowing one client to issue
tokens on behalf of another.

Kubernetes does not provide an OpenID Connect Identity Provider.
You can use an existing public OpenID Connect Identity Provider (such as Google, or
[others](https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-oauth-openid-connect-sdk/openid-connect-providers)).
Or, you can run your own Identity Provider, such as [dex](https://dexidp.io/),
[Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak),
CloudFoundry [UAA](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa), or
Tremolo Security's [OpenUnison](https://github.com/tremolosecurity/openunison).

For an identity provider to work with Kubernetes it must:

1.  Support [OpenID connect discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html); not all do.
2.  Run in TLS with non-obsolete ciphers
3.  Have a CA signed certificate (even if the CA is not a commercial CA or is self signed)

A note about requirement #3 above, requiring a CA signed certificate.  If you deploy your own identity provider (as opposed to one of the cloud providers like Google or Microsoft) you MUST have your identity provider's web server certificate signed by a certificate with the `CA` flag set to `TRUE`, even if it is self signed.  This is due to GoLang's TLS client implementation being very strict to the standards around certificate validation.  If you don't have a CA handy, you can use [this script](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/blob/master/examples/k8s/gencert.sh) from the Dex team to create a simple CA and a signed certificate and key pair.
Or you can use [this similar script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TremoloSecurity/openunison-qs-kubernetes/master/src/main/bash/makessl.sh) that generates SHA256 certs with a longer life and larger key size.

Setup instructions for specific systems:

- [UAA](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/uaa.html)
- [Dex](https://dexidp.io/docs/kubernetes/)
- [OpenUnison](https://www.tremolosecurity.com/orchestra-k8s/)

#### Using kubectl

##### Option 1 - OIDC Authenticator

The first option is to use the kubectl `oidc` authenticator, which sets the `id_token` as a bearer token for all requests and refreshes the token once it expires. After you've logged into your provider, use kubectl to add your `id_token`, `refresh_token`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` to configure the plugin.

Providers that don't return an `id_token` as part of their refresh token response aren't supported by this plugin and should use "Option 2" below.

```bash
kubectl config set-credentials USER_NAME \
   --auth-provider=oidc \
   --auth-provider-arg=idp-issuer-url=( issuer url ) \
   --auth-provider-arg=client-id=( your client id ) \
   --auth-provider-arg=client-secret=( your client secret ) \
   --auth-provider-arg=refresh-token=( your refresh token ) \
   --auth-provider-arg=idp-certificate-authority=( path to your ca certificate ) \
   --auth-provider-arg=id-token=( your id_token )
```

As an example, running the below command after authenticating to your identity provider:

```bash
kubectl config set-credentials mmosley  \
        --auth-provider=oidc  \
        --auth-provider-arg=idp-issuer-url=https://oidcidp.tremolo.lan:8443/auth/idp/OidcIdP  \
        --auth-provider-arg=client-id=kubernetes  \
        --auth-provider-arg=client-secret=1db158f6-177d-4d9c-8a8b-d36869918ec5  \
        --auth-provider-arg=refresh-token=q1bKLFOyUiosTfawzA93TzZIDzH2TNa2SMm0zEiPKTUwME6BkEo6Sql5yUWVBSWpKUGphaWpxSVAfekBOZbBhaEW+VlFUeVRGcluyVF5JT4+haZmPsluFoFu5XkpXk5BXqHega4GAXlF+ma+vmYpFcHe5eZR+slBFpZKtQA= \

Which would produce the below configuration:

```yaml

      name: oidc
```

Once your `id_token` expires, `kubectl` will attempt to refresh your `id_token` using your `refresh_token` and `client_secret` storing the new values for the `refresh_token` and `id_token` in your `.kube/config`.

##### Option 2 - Use the `--token` Option

The `kubectl` command lets you pass in a token using the `--token` option.  Copy and paste the `id_token` into this option:

```bash
kubectl --token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL21sYi50cmVtb2xvLmxhbjo4MDQzL2F1dGgvaWRwL29pZGMiLCJhdWQiOiJrdWJlcm5ldGVzIiwiZXhwIjoxNDc0NTk2NjY5LCJqdGkiOiI2RDUzNXoxUEpFNjJOR3QxaWVyYm9RIiwiaWF0IjoxNDc0NTk2MzY5LCJuYmYiOjE0NzQ1OTYyNDksInN1YiI6Im13aW5kdSIsInVzZXJfcm9sZSI6WyJ1c2VycyIsIm5ldy1uYW1lc3BhY2Utdmlld2VyIl0sImVtYWlsIjoibXdpbmR1QG5vbW9yZWplZGkuY29tIn0.f2As579n9VNoaKzoF-dOQGmXkFKf1FMyNV0-va_B63jn-_n9LGSCca_6IVMP8pO-Zb4KvRqGyTP0r3HkHxYy5c81AnIh8ijarruczl-TK_yF5akjSTHFZD-0gRzlevBDiH8Q79NAr-ky0P4iIXS8lY9Vnjch5MF74Zx0c3alKJHJUnnpjIACByfF2SCaYzbWFMUNat-K1PaUk5-ujMBG7yYnr95xD-63n8CO8teGUAAEMx6zRjzfhnhbzX-ajwZLGwGUBT4WqjMs70-6a7_8gZmLZb2az1cZynkFRj2BaCkVT3A2RrjeEwZEtGXlMqKJ1_I2ulrOVsYx01_yD35-rw get nodes
```


### Webhook Token Authentication

Webhook authentication is a hook for verifying bearer tokens.

* `--authentication-token-webhook-config-file` a configuration file describing how to access the remote webhook service.
* `--authentication-token-webhook-cache-ttl` how long to cache authentication decisions. Defaults to two minutes.
* `--authentication-token-webhook-version` determines whether to use `authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1` or `authentication.k8s.io/v1` 
  `TokenReview` objects to send/receive information from the webhook. Defaults to `v1beta1`.

The configuration file uses the [kubeconfig](/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/)
file format. Within the file, `clusters` refers to the remote service and
`users` refers to the API server webhook. An example would be:

```yaml
# Kubernetes API version
apiVersion: v1
# kind of the API object
kind: Config
# clusters refers to the remote service.
clusters:
  - name: name-of-remote-authn-service
    cluster:
      certificate-authority: /path/to/ca.pem         # CA for verifying the remote service.
      server: https://authn.example.com/authenticate # URL of remote service to query. 'https' recommended for production.

# users refers to the API server's webhook configuration.
users:
  - name: name-of-api-server
    user:
      client-certificate: /path/to/cert.pem # cert for the webhook plugin to use
      client-key: /path/to/key.pem          # key matching the cert

# kubeconfig files require a context. Provide one for the API server.
current-context: webhook
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: name-of-remote-authn-service
    user: name-of-api-server
  name: webhook
```

When a client attempts to authenticate with the API server using a bearer token as discussed [above](#putting-a-bearer-token-in-a-request),
the authentication webhook POSTs a JSON-serialized `TokenReview` object containing the token to the remote service.

Note that webhook API objects are subject to the same [versioning compatibility rules](/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/) as other Kubernetes API objects.
Implementers should check the `apiVersion` field of the request to ensure correct deserialization,
and **must** respond with a `TokenReview` object of the same version as the request.

{{< tabs name="TokenReview_request" >}}
{{% tab name="authentication.k8s.io/v1" %}}
{{< note >}}
The Kubernetes API server defaults to sending `authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1` token reviews for backwards compatibility.
To opt into receiving `authentication.k8s.io/v1` token reviews, the API server must be started with `--authentication-token-webhook-version=v1`.

### Authenticating Proxy

The API server can be configured to identify users from request header values, such as `X-Remote-User`.
It is designed for use in combination with an authenticating proxy, which sets the request header value.

* `--requestheader-username-headers` Required, case-insensitive. Header names to check, in order, for the user identity. The first header containing a value is used as the username.
* `--requestheader-group-headers` 1.6+. Optional, case-insensitive. "X-Remote-Group" is suggested. Header names to check, in order, for the user's groups. All values in all specified headers are used as group names.
* `--requestheader-extra-headers-prefix` 1.6+. Optional, case-insensitive. "X-Remote-Extra-" is suggested. Header prefixes to look for to determine extra information about the user (typically used by the configured authorization plugin). Any headers beginning with any of the specified prefixes have the prefix removed. The remainder of the header name is lowercased and [percent-decoded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1) and becomes the extra key, and the header value is the extra value.

{{< note >}}
Prior to 1.11.3 (and 1.10.7, 1.9.11), the extra key could only contain characters which were [legal in HTTP header labels](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.6).
{{< /note >}}

For example, with this configuration:

```
--requestheader-username-headers=X-Remote-User
--requestheader-group-headers=X-Remote-Group
--requestheader-extra-headers-prefix=X-Remote-Extra-
```

this request:

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
X-Remote-User: fido
X-Remote-Group: dogs
X-Remote-Group: dachshunds
X-Remote-Extra-Acme.com%2Fproject: some-project
X-Remote-Extra-Scopes: openid
X-Remote-Extra-Scopes: profile
```

would result in this user info:

```yaml
name: fido
groups:
- dogs
- dachshunds
extra:
  acme.com/project:
  - some-project
  scopes:
  - openid
  - profile
```


In order to prevent header spoofing, the authenticating proxy is required to present a valid client
certificate to the API server for validation against the specified CA before the request headers are
checked. WARNING: do **not** reuse a CA that is used in a different context unless you understand
the risks and the mechanisms to protect the CA's usage.

* `--requestheader-client-ca-file` Required. PEM-encoded certificate bundle. A valid client certificate must be presented and validated against the certificate authorities in the specified file before the request headers are checked for user names.
* `--requestheader-allowed-names` Optional. List of Common Name values (CNs). If set, a valid client certificate with a CN in the specified list must be presented before the request headers are checked for user names. If empty, any CN is allowed.


## Anonymous requests

When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are
treated as anonymous requests, and given a username of `system:anonymous` and a group of
`system:unauthenticated`.

For example, on a server with token authentication configured, and anonymous access enabled,
a request providing an invalid bearer token would receive a `401 Unauthorized` error.
A request providing no bearer token would be treated as an anonymous request.

In 1.5.1-1.5.x, anonymous access is disabled by default, and can be enabled by
passing the `--anonymous-auth=true` option to the API server.

In 1.6+, anonymous access is enabled by default if an authorization mode other than `AlwaysAllow`
is used, and can be disabled by passing the `--anonymous-auth=false` option to the API server.
Starting in 1.6, the ABAC and RBAC authorizers require explicit authorization of the
`system:anonymous` user or the `system:unauthenticated` group, so legacy policy rules
that grant access to the `*` user or `*` group do not include anonymous users.

## User impersonation

A user can act as another user through impersonation headers. These let requests
manually override the user info a request authenticates as. For example, an admin
could use this feature to debug an authorization policy by temporarily
impersonating another user and seeing if a request was denied.

Impersonation requests first authenticate as the requesting user, then switch
to the impersonated user info.

* A user makes an API call with their credentials _and_ impersonation headers.
* API server authenticates the user.
* API server ensures the authenticated users have impersonation privileges.
* Request user info is replaced with impersonation values.
* Request is evaluated, authorization acts on impersonated user info.

The following HTTP headers can be used to performing an impersonation request:

* `Impersonate-User`: The username to act as.
* `Impersonate-Group`: A group name to act as. Can be provided multiple times to set multiple groups. Optional. Requires "Impersonate-User".
* `Impersonate-Extra-( extra name )`: A dynamic header used to associate extra fields with the user. Optional. Requires "Impersonate-User". In order to be preserved consistently, `( extra name )` should be lower-case, and any characters which aren't [legal in HTTP header labels](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.6) MUST be utf8 and [percent-encoded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1).
* `Impersonate-Uid`: A unique identifier that represents the user being impersonated. Optional. Requires "Impersonate-User". Kubernetes does not impose any format requirements on this string.

{{< note >}}
Prior to 1.11.3 (and 1.10.7, 1.9.11), `( extra name )` could only contain characters which were [legal in HTTP header labels](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.6).
{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}
`Impersonate-Uid` is only available in versions 1.22.0 and higher.
{{< /note >}}

An example of the impersonation headers used when impersonating a user with groups:
```http
Impersonate-User: jane.doe@example.com
Impersonate-Group: developers
Impersonate-Group: admins
```

An example of the impersonation headers used when impersonating a user with a UID and
extra fields:
```http
Impersonate-User: jane.doe@example.com
Impersonate-Extra-dn: cn=jane,ou=engineers,dc=example,dc=com
Impersonate-Extra-acme.com%2Fproject: some-project
Impersonate-Extra-scopes: view
Impersonate-Extra-scopes: development
Impersonate-Uid: 06f6ce97-e2c5-4ab8-7ba5-7654dd08d52b
```

When using `kubectl` set the `--as` flag to configure the `Impersonate-User`
header, set the `--as-group` flag to configure the `Impersonate-Group` header.

```bash
kubectl drain mynode
```

```none
Error from server (Forbidden): User "clark" cannot get nodes at the cluster scope. (get nodes mynode)
```

Set the `--as` and `--as-group` flag:

```bash
kubectl drain mynode --as=superman --as-group=system:masters
```

```none
node/mynode cordoned
node/mynode drained
```

{{< note >}}
`kubectl` cannot impersonate extra fields or UIDs.
{{< /note >}}

To impersonate a user, group, user identifier (UID) or extra fields, the impersonating user must
have the ability to perform the "impersonate" verb on the kind of attribute
being impersonated ("user", "group", "uid", etc.). For clusters that enable the RBAC
authorization plugin, the following ClusterRole encompasses the rules needed to
set user and group impersonation headers:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: impersonator
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["users", "groups", "serviceaccounts"]
  verbs: ["impersonate"]
```

For impersonation, extra fields and impersonated UIDs are both under the "authentication.k8s.io" `apiGroup`.
Extra fields are evaluated as sub-resources of the resource "userextras". To
allow a user to use impersonation headers for the extra field "scopes" and
for UIDs, a user should be granted the following role:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: scopes-and-uid-impersonator
rules:
# Can set "Impersonate-Extra-scopes" header and the "Impersonate-Uid" header.
- apiGroups: ["authentication.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["userextras/scopes", "uids"]
  verbs: ["impersonate"]
```

The values of impersonation headers can also be restricted by limiting the set
of `resourceNames` a resource can take.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: limited-impersonator
rules:
# Can impersonate the user "jane.doe@example.com"
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["users"]
  verbs: ["impersonate"]
  resourceNames: ["jane.doe@example.com"]

# Can impersonate the groups "developers" and "admins"
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["groups"]
  verbs: ["impersonate"]
  resourceNames: ["developers","admins"]

# Can impersonate the extras field "scopes" with the values "view" and "development"
- apiGroups: ["authentication.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["userextras/scopes"]
  verbs: ["impersonate"]
  resourceNames: ["view", "development"]

# Can impersonate the uid "06f6ce97-e2c5-4ab8-7ba5-7654dd08d52b"
- apiGroups: ["authentication.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["uids"]
  verbs: ["impersonate"]
  resourceNames: ["06f6ce97-e2c5-4ab8-7ba5-7654dd08d52b"]
```

## client-go credential plugins

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.22" state="stable" >}}

`k8s.io/client-go` and tools using it such as `kubectl` and `kubelet` are able to execute an
external command to receive user credentials.

This feature is intended for client side integrations with authentication protocols not natively
supported by `k8s.io/client-go` (LDAP, Kerberos, OAuth2, SAML, etc.). The plugin implements the
protocol specific logic, then returns opaque credentials to use. Almost all credential plugin
use cases require a server side component with support for the [webhook token authenticator](#webhook-token-authentication)
to interpret the credential format produced by the client plugin.

### Example use case

In a hypothetical use case, an organization would run an external service that exchanges LDAP credentials
for user specific, signed tokens. The service would also be capable of responding to [webhook token
authenticator](#webhook-token-authentication) requests to validate the tokens. Users would be required
to install a credential plugin on their workstation.

To authenticate against the API:

* The user issues a `kubectl` command.
* Credential plugin prompts the user for LDAP credentials, exchanges credentials with external service for a token.
* Credential plugin returns token to client-go, which uses it as a bearer token against the API server.
* API server uses the [webhook token authenticator](#webhook-token-authentication) to submit a `TokenReview` to the external service.
* External service verifies the signature on the token and returns the user's username and groups.

### Configuration

Credential plugins are configured through [kubectl config files](/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/)
as part of the user fields.

Relative command paths are interpreted as relative to the directory of the config file. If
KUBECONFIG is set to `/home/jane/kubeconfig` and the exec command is `./bin/example-client-go-exec-plugin`,
the binary `/home/jane/bin/example-client-go-exec-plugin` is executed.

```yaml
- name: my-user
  user:
    exec:
      # Path relative to the directory of the kubeconfig
      command: "./bin/example-client-go-exec-plugin"
      apiVersion: "client.authentication.k8s.io/v1"
      interactiveMode: Never
```

### Input and output formats

The executed command prints an `ExecCredential` object to `stdout`. `k8s.io/client-go`
authenticates against the Kubernetes API using the returned credentials in the `status`.
The executed command is passed an `ExecCredential` object as input via the `KUBERNETES_EXEC_INFO`
environment variable. This input contains helpful information like the expected API version
of the returned `ExecCredential` object and whether or not the plugin can use `stdin` to interact
with the user.

When run from an interactive session (i.e., a terminal), `stdin` can be exposed directly
to the plugin. Plugins should use the `spec.interactive` field of the input
`ExecCredential` object from the `KUBERNETES_EXEC_INFO` environment variable in order to
determine if `stdin` has been provided. A plugin's `stdin` requirements (i.e., whether
`stdin` is optional, strictly required, or never used in order for the plugin
to run successfully) is declared via the `user.exec.interactiveMode` field in the
[kubeconfig](/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) (see table
below for valid values). The `user.exec.interactiveMode` field is optional in `client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1`
and required in `client.authentication.k8s.io/v1`.

{{< table caption="interactiveMode values" >}}
| `interactiveMode` Value | Meaning |
| ----------------------- | ------- |
| `Never` | This exec plugin never needs to use standard input, and therefore the exec plugin will be run regardless of whether standard input is available for user input. |
| `IfAvailable` | This exec plugin would like to use standard input if it is available, but can still operate if standard input is not available. Therefore, the exec plugin will be run regardless of whether stdin is available for user input. If standard input is available for user input, then it will be provided to this exec plugin. |
| `Always` | This exec plugin requires standard input in order to run, and therefore the exec plugin will only be run if standard input is available for user input. If standard input is not available for user input, then the exec plugin will not be run and an error will be returned by the exec plugin runner. |
{{< /table >}}

To use bearer token credentials, the plugin returns a token in the status of the
[`ExecCredential`](/docs/reference/config-api/client-authentication.v1beta1/#client-authentication-k8s-io-v1beta1-ExecCredential)

Alternatively, a PEM-encoded client certificate and key can be returned to use TLS client auth.
If the plugin returns a different certificate and key on a subsequent call, `k8s.io/client-go`
will close existing connections with the server to force a new TLS handshake.

If specified, `clientKeyData` and `clientCertificateData` must both must be present.

`clientCertificateData` may contain additional intermediate certificates to send to the server.

Optionally, the response can include the expiry of the credential formatted as a
RFC3339 timestamp. Presence or absence of an expiry has the following impact:

- If an expiry is included, the bearer token and TLS credentials are cached until
  the expiry time is reached, or if the server responds with a 401 HTTP status code,
  or when the process exits.
- If an expiry is omitted, the bearer token and TLS credentials are cached until
  the server responds with a 401 HTTP status code or until the process exits.

To enable the exec plugin to obtain cluster-specific information, set `provideClusterInfo` on the `user.exec`
field in the [kubeconfig](/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/).
The plugin will then be supplied this cluster-specific information in the `KUBERNETES_EXEC_INFO` environment variable.
Information from this environment variable can be used to perform cluster-specific
credential acquisition logic.
The following `ExecCredential` manifest describes a cluster information sample.
