## Pod {#Pod}

Pod is a collection of containers that can run on a host. This resource is created by clients and scheduled onto hosts.

<hr>

- **apiVersion**: v1


- **kind**: Pod


- **metadata** (<a href="{{< ref "../common-definitions/object-meta#ObjectMeta" >}}">ObjectMeta</a>)

  Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

- **spec** (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#PodSpec" >}}">PodSpec</a>)

  Specification of the desired behavior of the pod. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

- **status** (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#PodStatus" >}}">PodStatus</a>)

  Most recently observed status of the pod. This data may not be up to date. Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status





## PodSpec {#PodSpec}

PodSpec is a description of a pod.

<hr>



### Containers


- **containers** ([]<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#Container" >}}">Container</a>), required

  *Patch strategy: merge on key `name`*
  
  List of containers belonging to the pod. Containers cannot currently be added or removed. There must be at least one container in a Pod. Cannot be updated.

- **initContainers** ([]<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#Container" >}}">Container</a>)

  *Patch strategy: merge on key `name`*
  
  List of initialization containers belonging to the pod. Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be unique among all containers. Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes. The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of of that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers in a similar fashion. Init containers cannot currently be added or removed. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/

- **imagePullSecrets** ([]<a href="{{< ref "../common-definitions/local-object-reference#LocalObjectReference" >}}">LocalObjectReference</a>)

  *Patch strategy: merge on key `name`*
  
  ImagePullSecrets is an optional list of references to secrets in the same namespace to use for pulling any of the images used by this PodSpec. If specified, these secrets will be passed to individual puller implementations for them to use. For example, in the case of docker, only DockerConfig type secrets are honored. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod

- **enableServiceLinks** (boolean)

  EnableServiceLinks indicates whether information about services should be injected into pod's environment variables, matching the syntax of Docker links. Optional: Defaults to true.

### Volumes


- **volumes** ([]<a href="{{< ref "../config-and-storage-resources/volume#Volume" >}}">Volume</a>)

  *Patch strategies: retainKeys, merge on key `name`*
  
  List of volumes that can be mounted by containers belonging to the pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes

### Scheduling


- **nodeSelector** (map[string]string)

  NodeSelector is a selector which must be true for the pod to fit on a node. Selector which must match a node's labels for the pod to be scheduled on that node. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/

- **nodeName** (string)

  NodeName is a request to schedule this pod onto a specific node. If it is non-empty, the scheduler simply schedules this pod onto that node, assuming that it fits resource requirements.

- **affinity** (Affinity)

  If specified, the pod's scheduling constraints

  <a name="Affinity"></a>
  *Affinity is a group of affinity scheduling rules.*

  - **affinity.nodeAffinity** (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#NodeAffinity" >}}">NodeAffinity</a>)

    Describes node affinity scheduling rules for the pod.

  - **affinity.podAffinity** (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#PodAffinity" >}}">PodAffinity</a>)

    Describes pod affinity scheduling rules (e.g. co-locate this pod in the same node, zone, etc. as some other pod(s)).

  - **affinity.podAntiAffinity** (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#PodAntiAffinity" >}}">PodAntiAffinity</a>)

    Describes pod anti-affinity scheduling rules (e.g. avoid putting this pod in the same node, zone, etc. as some other pod(s)).

- **tolerations** ([]Toleration)

  If specified, the pod's tolerations.

  <a name="Toleration"></a>
  *The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.*

  - **tolerations.key** (string)

    Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

  - **tolerations.operator** (string)

    Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.

  - **tolerations.value** (string)

    Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

  - **tolerations.effect** (string)

    Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

  - **tolerations.tolerationSeconds** (int64)

    TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

- **schedulerName** (string)

  If specified, the pod will be dispatched by specified scheduler. If not specified, the pod will be dispatched by default scheduler.

- **runtimeClassName** (string)

  RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the node.k8s.io group, which should be used to run this pod.  If no RuntimeClass resource matches the named class, the pod will not be run. If unset or empty, the "legacy" RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an empty definition that uses the default runtime handler. More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/585-runtime-class This is a beta feature as of Kubernetes v1.14.

- **priorityClassName** (string)

  If specified, indicates the pod's priority. "system-node-critical" and "system-cluster-critical" are two special keywords which indicate the highest priorities with the former being the highest priority. Any other name must be defined by creating a PriorityClass object with that name. If not specified, the pod priority will be default or zero if there is no default.

- **priority** (int32)

  The priority value. Various system components use this field to find the priority of the pod. When Priority Admission Controller is enabled, it prevents users from setting this field. The admission controller populates this field from PriorityClassName. The higher the value, the higher the priority.

- **topologySpreadConstraints** ([]TopologySpreadConstraint)

  *Patch strategy: merge on key `topologyKey`*
  
  *Map: unique values on keys `topologyKey, whenUnsatisfiable` will be kept during a merge*
  
  TopologySpreadConstraints describes how a group of pods ought to spread across topology domains. Scheduler will schedule pods in a way which abides by the constraints. All topologySpreadConstraints are ANDed.

  <a name="TopologySpreadConstraint"></a>
  *TopologySpreadConstraint specifies how to spread matching pods among the given topology.*

  - **topologySpreadConstraints.maxSkew** (int32), required

    MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 1/1/0: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |   P   |   P   |       | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 1/1/1; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(2-0) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

  - **topologySpreadConstraints.topologyKey** (string), required

    TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each \<key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. It's a required field.

  - **topologySpreadConstraints.whenUnsatisfiable** (string), required

    WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
      but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
      skew.
    A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assigment for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

  - **topologySpreadConstraints.labelSelector** (<a href="{{< ref "../common-definitions/label-selector#LabelSelector" >}}">LabelSelector</a>)

    LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain.

### Lifecycle


- **restartPolicy** (string)

  Restart policy for all containers within the pod. One of Always, OnFailure, Never. Default to Always. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy

- **terminationGracePeriodSeconds** (int64)

  Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully. May be decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). If this value is nil, the default grace period will be used instead. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. Defaults to 30 seconds.

- **activeDeadlineSeconds** (int64)

  Optional duration in seconds the pod may be active on the node relative to StartTime before the system will actively try to mark it failed and kill associated containers. Value must be a positive integer.

- **readinessGates** ([]PodReadinessGate)

  If specified, all readiness gates will be evaluated for pod readiness. A pod is ready when all its containers are ready AND all conditions specified in the readiness gates have status equal to "True" More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-network/580-pod-readiness-gates

  <a name="PodReadinessGate"></a>
  *PodReadinessGate contains the reference to a pod condition*

  - **readinessGates.conditionType** (string), required

    ConditionType refers to a condition in the pod's condition list with matching type.

  Specifies the hostname of the Pod If not specified, the pod's hostname will be set to a system-defined value.

- **setHostnameAsFQDN** (boolean)

  If true the pod's hostname will be configured as the pod's FQDN, rather than the leaf name (the default). In Linux containers, this means setting the FQDN in the hostname field of the kernel (the nodename field of struct utsname). In Windows containers, this means setting the registry value of hostname for the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters to FQDN. If a pod does not have FQDN, this has no effect. Default to false.

- **subdomain** (string)

    If unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and permissions of any volume.

  - **securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy** (string)

    fsGroupChangePolicy defines behavior of changing ownership and permission of the volume before being exposed inside Pod. This field will only apply to volume types which support fsGroup based ownership(and permissions). It will have no effect on ephemeral volume types such as: secret, configmaps and emptydir.

      GMSACredentialSpecName is the name of the GMSA credential spec to use.

    - **securityContext.windowsOptions.hostProcess** (boolean)

      HostProcess determines if a container should be run as a 'Host Process' container. This field is alpha-level and will only be honored by components that enable the WindowsHostProcessContainers feature flag. Setting this field without the feature flag will result in errors when validating the Pod. All of a Pod's containers must have the same effective HostProcess value (it is not allowed to have a mix of HostProcess containers and non-HostProcess containers).  In addition, if HostProcess is true then HostNetwork must also be set to true.

- **overhead** (map[string]<a href="{{< ref "../common-definitions/quantity#Quantity" >}}">Quantity</a>)

  Overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod for a given RuntimeClass. This field will be autopopulated at admission time by the RuntimeClass admission controller. If the RuntimeClass admission controller is enabled, overhead must not be set in Pod create requests. The RuntimeClass admission controller will reject Pod create requests which have the overhead already set. If RuntimeClass is configured and selected in the PodSpec, Overhead will be set to the value defined in the corresponding RuntimeClass, otherwise it will remain unset and treated as zero. More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/688-pod-overhead/README.md This field is beta-level as of Kubernetes v1.18, and is only honored by servers that enable the PodOverhead feature.

  *Patch strategy: merge on key `name`*
  
  List of ephemeral containers run in this pod. Ephemeral containers may be run in an existing pod to perform user-initiated actions such as debugging. This list cannot be specified when creating a pod, and it cannot be modified by updating the pod spec. In order to add an ephemeral container to an existing pod, use the pod's ephemeralcontainers subresource. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the EphemeralContainers feature.

### Deprecated

If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell

- **args** ([]string)

  List of ports to expose from the container. Exposing a port here gives the system additional information about the network connections a container uses, but is primarily informational. Not specifying a port here DOES NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be accessible from the network. Cannot be updated.

  <a name="ContainerPort"></a>
  *ContainerPort represents a network port in a single container.*

  - **ports.containerPort** (int32), required

    Number of port to expose on the pod's IP address. This must be a valid port number, 0 \< x \< 65536.

### Lifecycle


- **lifecycle** (Lifecycle)

  Actions that the management system should take in response to container lifecycle events. Cannot be updated.

  <a name="Lifecycle"></a>

This cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

### Security Context


- **securityContext** (SecurityContext)

  SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with. If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields of PodSecurityContext. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/

  <a name="SecurityContext"></a>
  *SecurityContext holds security configuration that will be applied to a container. Some fields are present in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext.  When both are set, the values in SecurityContext take precedence.*

  - **securityContext.runAsUser** (int64)

    The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in PodSecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

  - **securityContext.runAsNonRoot** (boolean)

    Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such validation will be performed. May also be set in PodSecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

  - **securityContext.runAsGroup** (int64)

    The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime default if unset. May also be set in PodSecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

    - **securityContext.seccompProfile.type** (string), required

      type indicates which kind of seccomp profile will be applied. Valid options are:
      
      Localhost - a profile defined in a file on the node should be used. RuntimeDefault - the container runtime default profile should be used. Unconfined - no profile should be applied.

    - **securityContext.seccompProfile.localhostProfile** (string)

      localhostProfile indicates a profile defined in a file on the node should be used. The profile must be preconfigured on the node to work. Must be a descending path, relative to the kubelet's configured seccomp profile location. Must only be set if type is "Localhost".

  - **securityContext.seLinuxOptions** (SELinuxOptions)

    The SELinux context to be applied to the container. If unspecified, the container runtime will allocate a random SELinux context for each container.  May also be set in PodSecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

    <a name="SELinuxOptions"></a>
    *SELinuxOptions are the labels to be applied to the container*

    - **securityContext.seLinuxOptions.level** (string)

      Level is SELinux level label that applies to the container.

      GMSACredentialSpecName is the name of the GMSA credential spec to use.

    - **securityContext.windowsOptions.hostProcess** (boolean)

      HostProcess determines if a container should be run as a 'Host Process' container. This field is alpha-level and will only be honored by components that enable the WindowsHostProcessContainers feature flag. Setting this field without the feature flag will result in errors when validating the Pod. All of a Pod's containers must have the same effective HostProcess value (it is not allowed to have a mix of HostProcess containers and non-HostProcess containers).  In addition, if HostProcess is true then HostNetwork must also be set to true.

    - **securityContext.windowsOptions.runAsUserName** (string)

      The UserName in Windows to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to the user specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in PodSecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

### Debugging


- **stdin** (boolean)

  Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF. Default is false.

- **stdinOnce** (boolean)

  Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false

- **tty** (boolean)

  Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true. Default is false.



## EphemeralContainer {#EphemeralContainer}

An EphemeralContainer is a container that may be added temporarily to an existing pod for user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a pod is removed or restarted. If an ephemeral container causes a pod to exceed its resource allocation, the pod may be evicted. Ephemeral containers may not be added by directly updating the pod spec. They must be added via the pod's ephemeralcontainers subresource, and they will appear in the pod spec once added. This is an alpha feature enabled by the EphemeralContainers feature flag.

<hr>

- **name** (string), required

  Name of the ephemeral container specified as a DNS_LABEL. This name must be unique among all containers, init containers and ephemeral containers.

If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false

- **tty** (boolean)

  Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true. Default is false.

### Not allowed

  - **resources.requests** (map[string]<a href="{{< ref "../common-definitions/quantity#Quantity" >}}">Quantity</a>)

    Requests describes the minimum amount of compute resources required. If Requests is omitted for a container, it defaults to Limits if that is explicitly specified, otherwise to an implementation-defined value. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

- **lifecycle** (Lifecycle)

  Lifecycle is not allowed for ephemeral containers.

  <a name="Lifecycle"></a>
  *Lifecycle describes actions that the management system should take in response to container lifecycle events.

  - **lifecycle.postStart** (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#Handler" >}}">Handler</a>)

    PostStart is called immediately after a container is created. If the handler fails, the container is terminated and restarted according to its restart policy. Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks

  - **lifecycle.preStop** (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#Handler" >}}">Handler</a>)

    PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure, preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the container crashes or exits. The reason for termination is passed to the handler. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the PreStop hooked is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace period. Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes or until the termination grace period is reached.

      GMSACredentialSpecName is the name of the GMSA credential spec to use.

    - **securityContext.windowsOptions.hostProcess** (boolean)

      HostProcess determines if a container should be run as a 'Host Process' container. This field is alpha-level and will only be honored by components that enable the WindowsHostProcessContainers feature flag. Setting this field without the feature flag will result in errors when validating the Pod. All of a Pod's containers must have the same effective HostProcess value (it is not allowed to have a mix of HostProcess containers and non-HostProcess containers).  In addition, if HostProcess is true then HostNetwork must also be set to true.

  - **tcpSocket.host** (string)

    Optional: Host name to connect to, defaults to the pod IP.

- **initialDelaySeconds** (int32)

  Number of seconds after the container has started before liveness probes are initiated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

- **terminationGracePeriodSeconds** (int64)

  Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully upon probe failure. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this value overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). This is an alpha field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.

- **periodSeconds** (int32)

  How often (in seconds) to perform the probe. Default to 10 seconds. Minimum value is 1.

- **timeoutSeconds** (int32)

  Minimum consecutive failures for the probe to be considered failed after having succeeded. Defaults to 3. Minimum value is 1.

- **successThreshold** (int32)

  Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed. Defaults to 1. Must be 1 for liveness and startup. Minimum value is 1.





## PodStatus {#PodStatus}

PodStatus represents information about the status of a pod. Status may trail the actual state of a system, especially if the node that hosts the pod cannot contact the control plane.

<hr>

- **nominatedNodeName** (string)

  nominatedNodeName is set only when this pod preempts other pods on the node, but it cannot be scheduled right away as preemption victims receive their graceful termination periods. This field does not guarantee that the pod will be scheduled on this node. Scheduler may decide to place the pod elsewhere if other nodes become available sooner. Scheduler may also decide to give the resources on this node to a higher priority pod that is created after preemption. As a result, this field may be different than PodSpec.nodeName when the pod is scheduled.

- **hostIP** (string)

  IP address of the host to which the pod is assigned. Empty if not yet scheduled.

- **startTime** (Time)

  RFC 3339 date and time at which the object was acknowledged by the Kubelet. This is before the Kubelet pulled the container image(s) for the pod.

  <a name="Time"></a>
  *Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.*

- **phase** (string)

  The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its lifecycle. The conditions array, the reason and message fields, and the individual container status arrays contain more detail about the pod's status. There are five possible phase values:
  
  Pending: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the container images has not been created. This includes time before being scheduled as well as time spent downloading images over the network, which could take a while. Running: The pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created. At least one container is still running, or is in the process of starting or restarting. Succeeded: All containers in the pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted. Failed: All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system. Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the host of the pod.

      - **ephemeralContainerStatuses.lastState.terminated.signal** (int32)

        Signal from the last termination of the container

    - **ephemeralContainerStatuses.lastState.waiting** (ContainerStateWaiting)

      Details about a waiting container

      <a name="ContainerStateWaiting"></a>
      *ContainerStateWaiting is a waiting state of a container.*

      - **ephemeralContainerStatuses.lastState.waiting.message** (string)

        Message regarding why the container is not yet running.

      - **ephemeralContainerStatuses.lastState.waiting.reason** (string)

        (brief) reason the container is not yet running.

  - **ephemeralContainerStatuses.ready** (boolean), required

    Specifies whether the container has passed its readiness probe.

  - **ephemeralContainerStatuses.restartCount** (int32), required

    The number of times the container has been restarted, currently based on the number of dead containers that have not yet been removed. Note that this is calculated from dead containers. But those containers are subject to garbage collection. This value will get capped at 5 by GC.

  - **ephemeralContainerStatuses.started** (boolean)

    Specifies whether the container has passed its startup probe. Initialized as false, becomes true after startupProbe is considered successful. Resets to false when the container is restarted, or if kubelet loses state temporarily. Is always true when no startupProbe is defined.





## PodList {#PodList}

PodList is a list of Pods.

<hr>

- **items** ([]<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#Pod" >}}">Pod</a>), required

  List of pods. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md

- **apiVersion** (string)

  APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

- **kind** (string)

  Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

- **metadata** (<a href="{{< ref "../common-definitions/list-meta#ListMeta" >}}">ListMeta</a>)

### `get` read the specified Pod

#### HTTP Request

GET /api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/pods/{name}

#### Parameters


- **name** (*in path*): string, required

  name of the Pod


- **namespace** (*in path*): string, required

  <a href="{{< ref "../common-parameters/common-parameters#namespace" >}}">namespace</a>


- **pretty** (*in query*): string

  <a href="{{< ref "../common-parameters/common-parameters#pretty" >}}">pretty</a>



#### Response


200 (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#Pod" >}}">Pod</a>): OK

401: Unauthorized


### `get` read ephemeralcontainers of the specified Pod

#### HTTP Request

GET /api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/pods/{name}/ephemeralcontainers

#### Parameters


- **name** (*in path*): string, required

  name of the Pod


- **namespace** (*in path*): string, required

  <a href="{{< ref "../common-parameters/common-parameters#namespace" >}}">namespace</a>


- **pretty** (*in query*): string

  <a href="{{< ref "../common-parameters/common-parameters#pretty" >}}">pretty</a>



#### Response


200 (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#Pod" >}}">Pod</a>): OK

401: Unauthorized


### `get` read log of the specified Pod

#### HTTP Request

GET /api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/pods/{name}/log

#### Parameters


- **name** (*in path*): string, required

  name of the Pod


- **namespace** (*in path*): string, required

  <a href="{{< ref "../common-parameters/common-parameters#namespace" >}}">namespace</a>


- **container** (*in query*): string

  The container for which to stream logs. Defaults to only container if there is one container in the pod.


- **follow** (*in query*): boolean

  Follow the log stream of the pod. Defaults to false.


- **insecureSkipTLSVerifyBackend** (*in query*): boolean

  insecureSkipTLSVerifyBackend indicates that the apiserver should not confirm the validity of the serving certificate of the backend it is connecting to.  This will make the HTTPS connection between the apiserver and the backend insecure. This means the apiserver cannot verify the log data it is receiving came from the real kubelet.  If the kubelet is configured to verify the apiserver's TLS credentials, it does not mean the connection to the real kubelet is vulnerable to a man in the middle attack (e.g. an attacker could not intercept the actual log data coming from the real kubelet).


- **limitBytes** (*in query*): integer

  If set, the number of bytes to read from the server before terminating the log output. This may not display a complete final line of logging, and may return slightly more or slightly less than the specified limit.


- **pretty** (*in query*): string

  <a href="{{< ref "../common-parameters/common-parameters#pretty" >}}">pretty</a>


- **previous** (*in query*): boolean

  Return previous terminated container logs. Defaults to false.


- **sinceSeconds** (*in query*): integer

  A relative time in seconds before the current time from which to show logs. If this value precedes the time a pod was started, only logs since the pod start will be returned. If this value is in the future, no logs will be returned. Only one of sinceSeconds or sinceTime may be specified.


- **tailLines** (*in query*): integer

  If set, the number of lines from the end of the logs to show. If not specified, logs are shown from the creation of the container or sinceSeconds or sinceTime


- **timestamps** (*in query*): boolean

  If true, add an RFC3339 or RFC3339Nano timestamp at the beginning of every line of log output. Defaults to false.
